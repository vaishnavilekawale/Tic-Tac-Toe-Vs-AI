## 🎮 How to Play

- You play as ❌ and the AI plays as ⭕
- Take turns to mark the grid.
- The first to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all 9 cells are filled without a winner, it's a draw!

## 🧠 AI Logic

- The AI uses optimal move selection (random or minimax based).
- It prevents the user from winning and tries to win if possible.
- You can enhance the AI further with a minimax algorithm for unbeatable performance.
